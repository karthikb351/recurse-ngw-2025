# Tabletop Hackday
Date: Wednesday, 15th May - 3pm - 11pm

Join @captn3m0 and @karthikb351 for a hackday around tabletop games!

We're going to primarily work on building bots to explore strategies in some of our favourite games - Love Letter, Crew, Hanabi, and others.

There are a bunch of great frameworks and projects to build with, like [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/) and reinforcement learning frameworks like [pgx](https://github.com/sotetsuk/pgx).

@captn3m0 maintains a list of interesting [boardgame related research](https://github.com/captn3m0/boardgame-research), which might be a good starting point to discover some interesting rabbit hole.

This is intended to mostly be a self-directed event where people meet each other, talk, and collaborate. There might be a opt-in bot-writing challenge, but that is still in the works.
