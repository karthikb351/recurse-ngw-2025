Puzzled Pint is a casual, social puzzle solving event which happens at bars/pubs on the second Tuesday of every month in multiple cities around the world. Recurse alums @karthikb351 and @captn3m0 run the Bangalore chapter. Coincidentally it's happening during NGW, so people are invited to come participate. The event is walking distance from Underline Center at [Secret Story Bar & Kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BTA1AjFXwmkWczhV7). It is absolutely free to attend, so consider coming by!
